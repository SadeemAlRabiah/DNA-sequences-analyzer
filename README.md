 DNA-sequences-analyzer
ðŸ§¬ DNA Sequence Analyzer (Beginner Project)

A simple Python script that analyzes a DNA sequence using basic bioinformatics techniques.  
I built this project as a beginner in coding and bioinformatics to practice and learn.

 Features

- Validates that the sequence only contains A, T, C, and G
- Calculates:
  - Total sequence length
  - GC content (%)
  - Base composition percentages (A/T/C/G)
- Translates the DNA into a protein sequence (until the first stop codon)
- Displays a clean bar chart of base composition using `matplotlib`

 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)
- matplotlib

To install the libraries, run:

bash
pip install biopython matplotlib
